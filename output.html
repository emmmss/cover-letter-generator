I’m excited to apply for the Product Manager position at LeadDesk. I would love to be in a role where I can impact LeadDesks product development, building intelligent software that makes call centers run more efficiently.

I have been interested in the intersection of tech and business throughout my studies and career, from getting a Master’s in Information and Service Management at Aalto Biz, working for 4 years as a data scientist at a tech startup, to transitioning to a product management role at Wolt.

During my time as a product lead I took a brand new product from the ideation phase to launch. This included doing user research, collaborating with business stakeholders across the organization, gathering requirements and feedback, setting success metrics, analyzing data and coordinating A/B testing, and communicating the vision and progress. My responsibilities also included leading a development team consisting of engineers, designers, and analysts, and defining the roadmap and vision for the team.

In my past role I have learned how to think about building products with a business mindset. I have developed strong scoping and prioritization skills. I have navigated communication and stakeholder management in a complex organization, and in a challenging role. I believe that these skills would be extremely valuable in this position.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would love to hear more about the role and discuss how my experience meets your needs.
